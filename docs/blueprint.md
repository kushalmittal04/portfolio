# **App Name**: FolioForge

## Core Features:

- Education Display: Showcase educational background with institution names, courses, passing years, scores, and high-resolution mark sheet images viewable on click.
- Experience Showcase: Detail internships including company name, position, location, dates, descriptions, and tech stacks. Certificates and work images are displayed on a separate, linked page when the item is clicked.
- Project Carousel: Display projects in a carousel with project name, tech stack, description, GitHub link, and live demo link, with the capability to embed videos. Clicking a project navigates to a dedicated project details page.
- Certificate Zoom: Display certificates (Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn) in a grid layout, where clicking each certificate opens a zoomable view to enhance readability.
- Achievement Gallery: Showcase achievements (e.g., GATE, Blind Coding) including relevant images, which become viewable on click.
- Profile Aggregation: Aggregate links to external profiles on platforms like GitHub, Kaggle, and LeetCode, complete with key stats pulled directly from their APIs. Fallback gracefully by providing screenshots, if needed, on profiles where APIs are not available or inaccessible.
- Resume Download: Provide a direct link to download a resume (resume.pdf).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0E6EF) to ensure a calm and focused viewing experience.
- Accent color: Vibrant violet (#9400D3) to draw attention to important details.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a clean, modern sans-serif that's highly readable; Headline text: 'Playfair', which when paired with PT Sans makes the layout bolder.
- Simple line icons from a set like Feather or Heroicons for a modern and clean look.
- Use a responsive grid system for all pages, ensuring content adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- Use subtle fade-in animations as sections appear on the screen, enhancing user engagement without being distracting.
